Here is the resource production speeds from [Official Factorio Wiki](https://wiki.factorio.com/)

With no production modules, using electric mining drills and stone furnaces:

Smelting iron and copper: $\frac{5}{16}$ items/second
Electric mining drill: $\frac{8}{16}$ items/second

Ratio of mining to smelting: $8:5$

**8 stone furnaces and 5 electric mining drills produces $\frac{5}{2}$ items/second**
**1 yellow belt at $15$ items/second needs $48$ furnaces and $30$ electric mining drills**
(needs $\frac{54}{50}$ coal/second)


8 stone furnaces need $\frac{9}{50}$ coal/second.
1 electric mining drill produces $\frac{25}{50}$ coal/second. 


4 yellow belts need 192 furnaces need $\frac{216}{50}$ coal/second
9 coal mining drills needed.
